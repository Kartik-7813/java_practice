/* 
Table Generator in Java (basic microproject):- 

1. In this program, we will accept a number as input from user & then generate its multiplication table upto 10.
2. To take the input from user, we will use Scanner class object from .util package & we will use its nextInt() method to read an integer input. 
3. We will use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 10 & in each iteration & multiply the input number with the loop counter to get the product.
